# junit-parallel-runners
This is an implementation of a parallel test runner for JUnit 4. 
There is an [article](https://fractalglider.github.io/java/2016/06/27/parallel-runners-junit4.html) explaining its purpose in more detail.

Since [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5) is available since 2017, this project is probably obsolete, 
but it still might be helpful to some poor soul maintaining legacy code.
